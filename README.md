Udacity DEvOps Engineer Course Project#2

Deploy a high-availability web app using CloudFormation


This source code deploys the Udagram application, along with the necessary supporting software into its matching infrastructure.
The project is split into two parts:
    1 - Develop a diagram that can be presented as part of my portfolio and as a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script. And
    2 - Interpret the instructions as well as my own diagram and create a matching CloudFormation script.
